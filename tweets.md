4. __Code is provable__

- `Theme`: TDD provable code

Prove, error, write again. What if we develop a sense of feeling more confident writing code?
When you write your test, the most probably thing is to fail. So, you are not 100% sure on what you are doing if your tests are right written. Imagine what happend if you write your test, write your code and the test pass the 100% of your time. You wrote your code with a deep understanding. And you begin to develop a sense of feeling more confident. So amazing!
No more "prove, error, fix" and again. You develop with clarity and confident.
